## Project thoughts

Do Greenlandic voters support different parties than mainland Denmark voters within the General Danish elections and what party platforms do they prefer? In this study, I plan to examine voting patterns over time between four different voting regions during the Folketing, or General Danish Elections. Three of these regions are within Denmark (HOvedstaden, Midtjylland-Nordjylland, Sj√¶lland-Syddanmark), and the other region is Greenland. I hypothesize that Greenlandic votes will differ significantly from Danish votes. Greenland is still one of the few countries that is partially controlled by a colonial government. Due to this unique regional and political structure, I expect that Greenlandic voters align more with left-leaning platforms, especially due to factors such as social structure, cultural norms, environmentalism, and the salience of more progressive views such as Greenlandic sovereignty. I will be using election data from Statistics Denmark and the Straubinger/folketingsvalg dataset.
